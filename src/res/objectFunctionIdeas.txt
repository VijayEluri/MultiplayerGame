Objects to be defined, functions assocated with all objects.

All movable objects should have this..
 function that returns type of object.
 function to handle die event.
 function to handle being damaged from any object - has code to handle depending on what other object is, and
  may be based on amount of force applied to it, or others.
 function to set or return object health. (some objects has infinite health)
 
Possible ideas: 
Death objects: Would destroy everything that touches it. Could be useful as pit of death bottom, etc.
Death border: two parameters that set world abolute limit which objects that pass it will be removed from map.
	Would be good for memory cleanup of boxes, etc that fall into holes.
	
If any of those are implemented, all but ground or platform must have destroy bypass for those.

ground:
Infinite health, no damage accepted. Cannot be moved.
Zero damage on all objects hitting it.

platform: Same as ground.

smallbox:
unknown health (undefined, maybe 10x the player health?)
( probably have various sizes versions of this? )
When got hit with object...
Damage to players: zero.
Damage to weapons hitting it: depends on type.

player:
some X HP, assume 1000 for now.
When got hit with object...
Damage to players: zero.
Damage to weapons hitting it: depends on type.

Now for to be added objects:

bullet: (lets assume only one: bullets for now...)
One HP.
When got hit with object...
Damage to players: 10.
Damage to weapons hitting it: 100% depends on type.

Possibly this too..
healthpack:
100 HP (yes can be destroyed. :) )
When got hit with object...
Damage to players: -100. (restore health)
Damage to weapons hitting it: depends on type.
