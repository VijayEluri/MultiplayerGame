The format is pretty straightforward. There must be no empty lines.

This must appear first, and it tells game how many levels are in this levelset.
1

All level section starts with Level, and next line is title of this level, 
followed by type of game, like 0 for melee, 1 for flag, etc.
Then the mirror flag 1 or 0
then the scale double 
then the offset position

Level
Not much in this level!

true
5.5
0 0

Next up is list of the four X, Y positions for four spawn spots.
10 10
10 20
10 40
10 80

Next is basic Type of object, left, top, right, bottom, Rotation, Mass, Friction and Restitution
of boxes acting as floor, walls, etc. Right and bottom need only be specified for static objects
that are created dynamically (i.e. floors, platforms). Rotation is in degrees. If mass is negative 
it will be a static object.
