Run server.jar first and then run client.jar. The client will automatically connect to the server. After the client
connects to the server you will see a red rectangles signifying the players. There will be two players after the client
connects one controlled by the server and one controlled by the client. The players will be spawned in game map. 
The player can be controlled with the following keys:

w - jetpack
a - left
d - right
space - jump
mouse - aiming the crosshair
left mouse button - fire

Currently only the client can fire, but ironicly I broke the bullets on the client so the the server only shows the fired
bullets. 

The game will be fun. What can be better than running around and shooting each other. 

Both technical showpieces are in place. All networking issues are solved, with the exception of possibly spliting up the 
gamestate packet if it gets too large. Physics is completely finished.

The main components of the lowbar to be completed are projectile collisions and subsequent results, adding graphics and 
animations, deathmatch rules and gui aspects. We feel that there is a lot of work to be completed, but we are all 
committed to completing the lowbar.
